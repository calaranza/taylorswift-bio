			<h2>Re-recorded Albums</h2>
			<p>Taylor Swift began re-recording her first six studio albums in 2020 amid the ownership dispute of her master recordings with her former label, Big Machine Records. Last May 25, 2025, she regained full ownership of those albums after purchasing them from Shamrock Capital, crediting the success of her re-recording project and the Eras Tour.</p>
